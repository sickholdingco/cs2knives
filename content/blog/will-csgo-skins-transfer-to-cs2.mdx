<Callout>Will CS:GO skins transfer to CS2? We have the answer!</Callout>

For the last 12 years, people all over the world have been captivated by the skins and knives available in CS:GO. Hardcore fans like us have spent that time collecting impressive inventories and spending ungodly amounts of money on skins and knives. Sure, Counter-Strike is fun to play on its own but let’s be honest, some of us are just here to collect our skins and leave.

The highly anticipated [Counter-Strike 2](https://www.counter-strike.net/cs2) is set to release this summer. Many long standing fans are worried that their time spent searching for the best skins in the game will go to waste. Don’t worry, because Valve has given us information on what will happen to all of our old CS:GO skins when CS2 releases.

## What will happen to old CS:GO skins?

We have great news for you all! [Valve has officially confirmed](https://www.counter-strike.net/cs2) that **all inventory items in CS:GO will transfer to CS2**. Not only will all of your skins and knives be playable in this new iteration of Counter-Strike, but they will benefit from Source 2 lighting and materials.

Valve themselves have stated that “in addition to supporting legacy models and finishes, all stock weapons have been upgraded with high-resolution models, and some weapon finishes take advantage of these new models.”

This means we will all be able to use our hard earned skins from CS:GO and see them in a whole new light!

## Will the value of old skins remain the same?

Many players have been asking an interesting question when it comes to CS:GO skins: will they retain their value in CS2?

While we can only speculate what might happen to the value of our skins in CS2, we do know that some skin prices have skyrocketed amongst the announcement of Counter-Strike 2. Skins are valued based on a variety of different factors, including rarity, wear, and more. Some are hypothesizing that the new CS2 lighting may affect the value of some skins, as they may appear slightly different than they did in CS:GO.

There are certainly those out there that are hoping their skins maintain value within the CS2 ecosystem. One of those people is certainly the owner of the most expensive skin, the Karambit Case Hardened (Blue Gem). This skin is estimated to be [worth over $2 million](https://www.dexerto.com/csgo/most-expensive-csgo-skins-1340162/). A loss in value here would be nothing less than tragic.

## Importance of skins in Counter-Strike

From the beginning of CS:GO, skins have solidified themselves as a major part of the Counter-Strike ecosystem. In fact, it was estimated by Anomaly, a CS YouTuber, that Valve makes over [$54 million per month](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zhng7hg9chE&t=389s) on CS:GO cases.

With this being such an important pillar of revenue for Valve, we can expect the same type of attention and treatment for skins in CS2.

<Conclusion>
  We now know that skins are transferring seamlessly from CS:GO to CS2, but many
  unanswered questions around the new game’s launch still remain. What we do
  know is that Valve is paying special attention to skins and knives in CS2. We
  are eager to find out what lies ahead!
</Conclusion>
